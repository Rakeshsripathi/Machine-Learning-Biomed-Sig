Now, let's run the first cell of the.ipynb file in VS Code, which will create a CSV file with emotion labels
Split 90% into training and 10% into test data. Apply PCA for reducing the dimensionality while retaining 95% variance and perform cross-validation to find the optimal number of components.
Train the SVM model on the PCA-reduced data and calculate the accuracy and confusion matrix.
Train the Random Forest model on the PCA-reduced data and evaluate its performance using similar metrics. 
Compare SVM and Random Forest models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Perform an ANOVA test to statistically validate the impact of the hyperparameters.
Identify the best-performing model for emotion classification by considering the above steps.
